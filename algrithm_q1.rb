# 1
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
#
# Example:
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
#
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].


# 2
# You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers.
# The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
# Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
#
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :next
#     def initialize(val)
#         @val = val
#         @next = nil
#     end
# end


# 3
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
#
# Examples:
#
# Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
#
# Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
#
# Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
#
# Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


# 4
# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).


# 5
# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.
# You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.


# 6
# The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
#
# P   A   H   N
# A P L S I I G
# Y   I   R
# And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"


# 7
# Reverse digits of an integer.
#
# Example1: x = 123, return 321
# Example2: x = -123, return -321


# 8. String to Integer (atoi)


# 9
# Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.
# Do this without extra space.


# 10
# Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
#
# '.' Matches any single character.
# '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
#
# The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
#
# The function prototype should be:
# bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)
#
# Some examples:
# isMatch("aa","a") → false
# isMatch("aa","aa") → true
# isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
# isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
# isMatch("aa", ".*") → true
# isMatch("ab", ".*") → true
# isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → true
